        <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img src="kaiying-lin.jpg" alt="Me in my room" class="profile-photo">
            <p>I am a linguist and a computer scientist!I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Linguistics and a Master’s student in Computer Science, at the University of Hawai’i.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
        Before UH, I obtained my Master’s degree in Chinese Linguistics from the University of Tokyo, and my Bachelor’s degree in Japanese from the National Taiwan University. </br>
        </br>
        My research crosses two important aspects:</br>
        In Linguistics, I am interested in using computational modeling and language acquisition methods to examine syntax/semantics issues. </br>
        I conducted research in language acquisition, syntax/semantics, and computational modeling of language problems. </br>
        My dissertation examines the child language acquisition of Mandarin unaccusativity. </br>
        I proposed that language-specific environment can actively affect the categories of unaccusativity, and a theory should include the aspect of language environment, in addition to the semantics of verbs. </br>
        In addition to Mandarin, I also studied the child language acquisition of the Voice system in Paiwan, an Austronesian language in Taiwan. </br>
        I had a few studies in historical syntax, which studied the historical change of Taiwanese, and functional words in Tangut.</br>
        </br>
        In Computer Science, I am working under Peter Y. Washington’s lab and have conducted a few studies in detecting healthcare issues using language data, such as dementia and ADHD, Autism. </br>
        I used the approaches of fine-tuning pre-trained models and evaluating LLM.</br></p>
