        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Linguistics and a Master’s student in Computer Science, at the University of Hawai’i. 
        Before UH, I obtained my Master’s degree in Chinese Linguistics from the University of Tokyo, and my Bachelor’s degree in Japanese from the National Taiwan University. 
        
        My research crosses two important aspects:
        In Linguistics, I am interested in using computational modeling and language acquisition methods to examine syntax/semantics issues. 
        I conducted research in language acquisition, syntax/semantics, and computational modeling of language problems. 
        My dissertation examines the child language acquisition of Mandarin unaccusativity. 
        I proposed that language-specific environment can actively affect the categories of unaccusativity, and a theory should include the aspect of language environment, in addition to the semantics of verbs. 
        In addition to Mandarin, I also studied the child language acquisition of the Voice system in Paiwan, an Austronesian language in Taiwan. 
        I had a few studies in historical syntax, which studied the historical change of Taiwanese, and functional words in Tangut.

        In Computer Science, I am working under Peter Y. Washington’s lab and have conducted a few studies in detecting healthcare issues using language data, such as dementia and ADHD, Autism. 
        I used the approaches of fine-tuning pre-trained models and evaluating LLM..</p>
